Another resource is this [one](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interviewing-google-heres-6-things-you-absolutely-need-anthony-mays/?trk=pulse_spock-articles) 

Another book is cracking the code interview can be found anywhere on the internet.

Day 1 and Day 2 : 

I will be doing a research on how the google interview goes, I will be preparing for the google one because it's the best company any one can dream about it's like playing in a top team in premier league, Manchester City. If you can pass the google interview you can pass any other company interview.
